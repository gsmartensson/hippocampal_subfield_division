# hippocampal_subfield_division
Matlab script used for hippocampal subfield division described in "Atrophy of the Posterior Subiculum Is Associated with Memory Impairment, Tau-and Aβ Pathology in Non-demented Individuals" by Lindberg et al. (2017). 

The script currently only works on MRI brain images segmented using FreeSufer 6.0. It requires the folders of all segmented images to be placed in the same folder. A user needs to specify the path to this folder and output .csv file names in script.

If using this script in research, please cite:
